Files in here are for template snippets that contain only possibly single
words that will be added to more complete templates. For this reason these
templates should include extra space in beginning of text, unless text is
empty when it should be just "".

" something witty" - OK
"not like this" - Not OK, missing space
" also not like this " - Not OK, extra space in end
